	      <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
	      I believe we are here on this earth to make the world a better place, while this is extremely cliche, it is how I feel. Society has a lot of big problems facing it, such as climate change, pollution, violence (eg gun violence), <strong>lack of education</strong>, unemployment, government corruption, malnourishment &#38; hunger, lack of affordable housing and mass transit are just a few. Big Problems are any difficult problem where there is no clear or obvious answer, but solving the problem would positively impact thousands or even millions of people. I believe we are here to solve these problems.

	      <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
	      &ldquo;The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.&rdquo; - Ralph Waldo Emerson <br> Often people say the purpose of life is to be happy, but how do we achieve that happiness. For me, I am most content when I am the most useful. This is often when I create something that others can use to enhance their lives. There are a lot of things that we as a society can create, but I would rather focus on creating something that fixes or attempt to fix one of the aforementioned big problems.

      <div class="card-body">
	      <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
	      These concepts are not relevant because there is no such thing. There is no good or evil. It is all perspective. For example, you can argue that companies that are polluting our air, rivers, and streams are evil, but they are only doing what they think is the right thing. By labeling something good and something evil, we create this &ldquo;us vs them&rdquo; mentality and that does <strong>not</strong> work. We need to bring people into the fold, not exclude them. If you have a goal and you want to solve it, the more people you have helping you with that goal, the better.

	      I work because I like growing and learning as a person. I like building things and I like seeing those applications make people&#39;s lives better. I get a sense of accomplishment when I build something and see others using it. I&#39;m very goal oriented, so crushing goals at work is another reason I work.

	      Worthwhile work is work that contributes to a solution in one or more of the aforementioned big problems. Worthwhile work benefits others, while simultaneously the one doing the work is growing and learning.

      <div class="card-body">
	      <strong>Answer:</strong><br> Not all work is paid, but work we do as part of a job typically is and should be. Money helps us achieve our personal and financial goals, such as traveling or buying a house or car or paying off debt. When we are paid fairly for our work, we feel valued. Money also gives us the confidence to get married or start a family. Money can&#39;t buy happiness, but without it, it can certainly lead to unhappiness or worry.

    <div id="collapse11" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading11" data-parent="#accordion">
      <div class="card-body">
	      <strong>Answer:</strong><br>Growth, fulfillment, and impact have everything do with work. I try to avoid work that does not contribute to growth, fulfillment or impact. If I&#39;m not growing, then I&#39;m stagnating. If I&#39;m not fulfilled by my work, then I question if my time and effort could be better spent elsewhere. If I&#39;m not making an impact, then someone else should replace me. I can usually survive without one of the three for a little bit of time, but never indefinitely because without all three, I will be unhappy. I have been at jobs for extended periods of time where one or more of the three was missing and it was difficult to find motivation to go to work and give 100% effort. I would also add that recognition for work is equally important.
