        <h4>Final Project from my Android Class</h4>
        <p>
        In September 2013 I took an Android Development class at Cal Poly with <a href="https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~djanzen/">Professor David Janzen</a>. The class taught the basics of <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/android/">Android</a>, such as how to create list, save files, networking, integrating maps, and many other important skills necessary in creating a great Android app. However, Professor Janzen realized it is not possible to teach us everything in only 10 weeks. As a final project, he had us work with Graphic Communication (GrC) students to build an app that we would make available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en">Google Play Store</a>. I heard about <a href="http://www.kristinyeh.com/">Kristen Yeh</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aligmortensen">Ali Mortensen</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rachael-katra/36/13a/28b">Rachel Katra</a>'s idea for an app that would allow (mainly) women to sort and organize their clothing at the <a href="http://www.calpolynews.calpoly.edu/news_releases/2013/March/hackathonwinners.html">Evernote Hackathon</a>. The team designed a great app and placed third in the competition. I wanted to work on their idea as part of my final project to make it a reality. Another developer in the class (and a graduate student), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanching">Bryan Ching</a>, also liked their idea and wanted to work together on it. He and I spent many hours deciding what features and functionality to build into our original alpha. We spent many more hours writing the Android and PHP code to make it a reality.<br>
        After much hardwork, we finished the app! We were successful in building a functional prototype! You were able to login using Facebook, take pictures of clothing items, tag and categorized them, and add them to your virtual closet. The app would have been a great success, but unfortunately there exists one bug, which we were unable to squash before turning it in. The bug caused the app to crash every so often (due to a memory leak). Also the GrC students never really provided us with all the assets (backgrounds, icons, and textures) that we needed. However, considering we had limited time and lots of other classwork, I was happy with our end result. I would like to work on the app more in the future and return it to the app store. While the app is no longer on the Play Store, you can see mockups of the app <a href="http://www.kristinyeh.com/mobilecloset.html">here</a>.
