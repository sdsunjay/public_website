      <h1>StudyGuard</h1>
      <h2>Startup Weekend Santa Maria 2014</h2>
      <p>In April 2014, I worked with <a href="https://github.com/tsaifi9">Talha</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/slewson">Spencer</a>, Sam, <a href="https://github.com/e-lau">Elaine</a>, and my good friend <a href='http://ianmitchell.io/'>Ian</a> to revolutionize how students study for exams. Our peers told us that they were constantly remaking study guides others had already made or not being included in study groups. Even worse, some students were leeching off the work others had done in creating a study guide. Benefitting from study guides others have spent hours creating without contributing in any way is a big problem on college campuses. We solved that with the creation of <a href="https://github.com/tsaifi9/StudyGuard">StudyGuard</a>. StudyGuard is a Ruby on Rails app that allows students to easily share study guides and notes, while only allowing those that have contributed in some way to view the study guide. It was great working with Ian again on this project as I was able to learn even more Ruby on Rails. He taught me how easy it is to get a working app up and running in just minutes using Rails &amp; Foundation. Our team worked really hard solving a host of technical challenges throughout the weekend. At the end of the weekend, we presented our MVP to the judges. They were impressed with our work and saw how much we had accomplished. We were awarded third place in the competition! Read Ian's blog post about the weekend <a href='http://ianmitchell.io/2014/04/07/study-guard/'>here</a>. See more pictures from the event <a href='list.html'>here</a>.</p>
