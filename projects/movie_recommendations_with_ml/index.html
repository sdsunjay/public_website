    <h1>Movie Recommendations with ML</h1>
    <h4>Personalized Movie Recommendations using Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>A movie recommendations platform that utilizes cutting edge machine learning to make movie recommendations for you based on the movies you and your friends have liked.</p>
    <p>
        Movie Recommendations with ML has been developed as a research project. It is of my own design, but was inspired by
        <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eaugusti/pages/about/index.php">Eriq Augustine</a>, who is pursuing his PhD at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>. I met with him in July and he told me about this new machine
        learning framework called
        <a href="http://psl.linqs.org">PSL</a>
        that has been getting astounding results. I read some of
        <a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/biblio">the publications</a>
        about it and its really cool what he and the team working on it have done. However, I&#39;m not doing anything groundbreaking in this project. I&#39;m trying to duplicate the results the researchers obtained when using PSL to make
        recommendations (<a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/node/337">see their publication</a>), except I’m using my a new set of data. The data, which is essential for the success of this project, is coming from you, the user. Everytime
        you like or dislike a movie, we utilize your review to make recommendations better for everyone. Thank you so much for making this possible!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I&#39;ve been working since August 2018 to create a
        <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a> application users can use to get movie recommendations. Netflix and lots of other companies already provide movie recommendations, but these recommendations will be super accurate. If
        they aren&#39;t, <a href="#contact">please let me know</a>. If you experience any trouble accessing <a href="https://movierecommendationswithml.com">https://movierecommendationswithml.com</a>, please let me know. You could have
        found a bug. 😱 This site is constantly in development, so I expect there to be some bugs initially. Once again, if you find something, let me know. I want to make this site better for you and your friends. As of this writing, the
        recommendations engine is still in development, once users have rated enough movies, the real fun begins of making the recommendations 😊 . In the meantime, please start reviewing movies.
