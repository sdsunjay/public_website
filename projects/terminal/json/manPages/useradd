USERADD(8)                System Management Commands                USERADD(8)

NAME
       useradd - create a new user or update default new user information

SYNOPSIS
       useradd [options] LOGIN

       useradd -D

       useradd -D [options]

DESCRIPTION
       When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new user account using the values specified on the command line and the default
       values from the system. Depending on command line options, the useradd command will update system files and may also create the new user’s home
       directory and copy initial files. The version provided with Red Hat Linux will create a group for each user added to the system by default.

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the useradd command are:

       -c, --comment COMMENT
          Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the user’s full name.

       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
          The default base directory for the system if -d dir is not specified.  BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define the home
          directory. If the -m option is not used, BASE_DIR must exist.

       -d, --home HOME_DIR
          The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user’s login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to BASE_DIR
          and use that as the login directory name. The directory HOME_DIR does not have to exist but will not be created if it is missing.

       -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
          The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

       -f, --inactive INACTIVE
          The number of days after a password expires until the account is permanently disabled. A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the
          password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature. The default value is -1.

       -g, --gid GROUP
          The group name or number of the user’s initial login group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.
          /etc/default/useradd.

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
          A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening
          whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The default is for the user to belong only
          to the initial group.

      -h, --help
          Display help message and exit.

       -M The user’s home directory will not be created, even if the system wide settings from /etc/login.defs is to create home dirs.

       -m, --create-home
          The user’s home directory will be created if it does not exist. The files contained in SKEL_DIR will be copied to the home directory if the -k
          option is used, otherwise the files contained in /etc/skel will be used instead. Any directories contained in SKEL_DIR or /etc/skel will be
          created in the user’s home directory as well. The -k option is only valid in conjunction with the -m option. The default is to not create the
          directory and to not copy any files.

       -l Do not add the user to the last login log file. This is an option added by Red Hat.

       -n A group having the same name as the user being added to the system will be created by default. This option will turn off this Red Hat Linux
          specific behavior. When this option is used, users by default will be placed in whatever group is specified in /etc/default/useradd. If no
          default group is defined, group 1 will be used.

       -K, --key KEY=VALUE
          Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults (UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).

          Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating system account to turn off password ageing, even though system account has no password
          at all. Multiple -K options can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100
           -K UID_MAX=499

          Note: -K UID_MIN=10,UID_MAX=499 doesn’t work yet.

       -o, --non-unique
          Allow the creation of a user account with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.

       -p, --password PASSWORD
          The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the account.

       -r This flag is used to create a system account. That is, a user with a UID lower than the value of UID_MIN defined in /etc/login.defs and whose
          password does not expire. Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such an user, regardless of the default setting in
          /etc/login.defs. You have to specify -m option if you want a home directory for a system account to be created. This is an option added by Red
          Hat

       -s, --shell SHELL
          The name of the user’s login shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default login shell.
