TREE(1)                                                                TREE(1)

NAME
       tree - list contents of directories in a tree-like format.

SYNOPSIS
       tree  [-adfghilnopqrstuvxACDFNS] [-L level [-R]] [-H baseHREF] [-T title]
       [-o filename] [--nolinks] [-P pattern] [-I pattern] [--inodes] [--device]
       [--noreport]  [--dirsfirst]  [--version] [--help] [--filelimit #] [direc-
       tory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tree is a recursive directory  listing  program  that  produces  a  depth
       indented  listing  of  files.   Color  is  supported ala dircolors if the
       LS_COLORS environment variable is set, output is to a  tty,  and  the  -C
       flag  is  used.   With  no arguments, tree lists the files in the current
       directory.  When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the  files
       and/or  directories  found  in  the given directories each in turn.  Upon
       completion of listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total
       number of files and/or directories listed.

       By  default,  when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the sym-
       bolic link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the format:

           name -> real-path

       If  the  ‘-l’  option  is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual
       directory, then tree will follow the path of the symbolic link as  if  it
       were a real directory.

OPTIONS
       Tree understands the following command line switches:

       --help Outputs a verbose usage listing.

       --version
              Outputs the version of tree.

       -a     All  files  are  printed.   By  default tree does not print hidden
              files (those beginning with a dot ‘.’).  In  no  event  does  tree
              print  the file system constructs ‘.’ (current directory) and ‘..’
              (previous directory).

       -d     List directories only.

       -f     Prints the full path prefix for each file.

       -i     Makes tree not print the indentation lines, useful  when  used  in
              conjunction with the -f option.

       -l     Follows  symbolic  links  if they point to directories, as if they
              were directories. Symbolic links that will result in recursion are avoided when detected.

       -x     Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala find -xdev.

  -o filename
              Send output to filename.

FILES
       /etc/DIR_COLORS          System color database.
       ~/.dircolors             Users color database.

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS      Color information created by dircolors
       TREE_CHARSET   Character set for tree to use in HTML mode.
       LC_CTYPE       Locale for filename output.

BUGS
       Tree  does  not  prune "empty" directories when the -P and -I options are
       used.  Tree prints directories as it comes to them, so cannot  accumulate
       information  on  files and directories beneath the directory it is print-
       ing.

       The -h option rounds to the nearest whole number unlike the ls  implemen-
       tation  of  -h which rounds up always.  The IEC standard names for powers
       of 2 cooresponding to metric powers of 10 (KiBi, et al.) are silly.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I,  -P  and  --filelimit  options
       will lead to incorrect file/directory count reports.

       Probably more.
