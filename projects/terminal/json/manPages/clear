NAME
       clear - clear the terminal screen

SYNOPSIS
       clear

DESCRIPTION
       clear clears your screen if this is possible.  It looks in the environment for the terminal type and then in the terminfo database to figure out how to clear the screen.

       clear ignores any command-line parameters that may be present.
