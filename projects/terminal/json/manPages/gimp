DESCRIPTION
       GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It  is  used  to  edit  and
       manipulate  images. It can load and save a variety of image formats and
       can be used to convert between formats.

       GIMP can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of  drawing
       and  painting  tools  such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint brush.
       Painting and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a variety of
       paint modes.  It also offers an extensive array of selection tools like
       rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select, intelligent  scissors,
       and select by color.

       GIMP  offers  a  variety  of  plug-ins  that perform a variety of image
       manipulations.  Examples include bumpmap, edge detect,  gaussian  blur,
       and  many  others.  In  addition,  GIMP has several scripting extension
       which allow for advanced non-interactive  processing  and  creation  of
       images.

       GIMP  ships  with a second binary called gimp-console. This binary is a
       console-only version and  behaves  as  if  gimp  was  called  with  the
       --no-interface command-line option.

       On  platforms  with  the D-Bus message bus system, GIMP will by default
       check if an instance is already running in this  user  session.  If  it
       detects  that,  it will pass all filenames given on the command-line to
       the already running GIMP instance and quit.

       -h, --help
               Show GIMP command-line options.

       -v, --version

SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
       Any  bugs  found  should  be reported to the online bug-tracking system
       available on the web at  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/.  Before  reporting
       bugs, please check to see if the bug has already been reported.

       When  reporting GIMP bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
       reproduce the bug, version number of GIMP (and probably GTK+), OS  name
       and  version,  and  any  relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
       crash, it is very useful if a stack  trace  can  be  provided.  And  of
       course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.

OTHER INFO

       you can find links to just about many other GIMP sites, tutorials, data
       sets, mailing list archives, and more.

       There  is  also  a  GIMP User Manual available at https://docs.gimp.org/
       that goes into much more detail about the interactive use of GIMP.
