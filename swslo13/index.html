        <h4>Startup Weekend San Luis Obispo 2013 Project</h4>
        <p>
        Since I can remember, I have been fascinated by the stock market. I was always interested in why it goes up and down (sometimes drastically), which I later found out is somewhat related to public sentiment regarding a company, as well as other factors. The idea to use Twitter to try and predict the stock market took hold after speaking with my friend and mentor, Eriq Augustine. He had been very successful in using Twitter to detect outage in Netflix by using natural language processing (NLP) of Netflix-related tweets. At the second annual Startup Weekend San Luis Obispo event, I pitched my idea and was able to form a team. The six of us worked on my idea through the weekend. However during the event, we pivoted from trying to predict the stock market to gauging customer satisfaction for a company. Fortunately the underlying technology stayed the same. Although we worked hard, we did not win the event, but we decided to continue with our idea and enter a startup competition at Cal Poly called <a href="http://innovationquest.org/calpoly">Innovation Quest</a> (iQ). <br>
        For the next 3 months, we worked hard further developing the technology and business.  I focused on completing the application. With no help from my team, I wrote the code to call the Twitter API in order to gather and store tweets for sentiment analysis. I also became familiar with how NLP works and integrated Weka, a Java machine learning library, into our application to classify tweets. The challenge was gathering tweets from Twitter, having our application understand the content, and then classifying them. I not only worked hard on this highly technical problem, spending hours reading about NLP and writing Java code to make it work, but I also did all the project management. I scheduled meetings, submitting our application to iQ, prepared our presentation, tracked issues and tasks to be completed, and many other miscellaneous things. Our hard work paid off when we were told we were finalists in the competition, which received over 100 applications. However we did not win the competition, but it was a personal win because of all the things I learned along the way and all the small successes we had. At the end, I was proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish. I encourage you to read more about our project <a href="app.pdf">here</a>.
