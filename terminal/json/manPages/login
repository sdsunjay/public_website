LOGIN(1)                   Linux Programmer’s Manual                  LOGIN(1)

NAME
       login - sign on

SYNOPSIS
       login [ name ]
       login -p
       login -h hostname
       login -f name

DESCRIPTION
       login is used when signing onto a system.

       If an argument is not given, login prompts for the username.

       If the user is not root, and if /etc/nologin exists, the contents of this file are printed to the screen, and the login is terminated.  This is typ-
       ically used to prevent logins when the system is being taken down.

       If special access restrictions are specified for the user in /etc/usertty, these must be met, or the log in attempt will be denied and a syslog mes-
       sage will be generated. See the section on "Special Access Restrictions".

       If the user is root, then the login must be occurring on a tty listed in /etc/securetty.  Failures will be logged with the syslog facility.

       After  these  conditions  have been checked, the password will be requested and checked (if a password is required for this username).  Ten attempts
       are allowed before login dies, but after the first three, the response starts to get very slow.  Login failures are reported via the  syslog  facil-
       ity.  This facility is also used to report any successful root logins.

       If  the  file  .hushlogin  exists, then a "quiet" login is performed (this disables the checking of mail and the printing of the last login time and
       message of the day).  Otherwise, if /var/log/lastlog exists, the last login time is printed (and the current login is recorded).

       Random administrative things, such as setting the UID and GID of the tty are performed.  The TERM environment variable is preserved,  if  it  exists
       (other environment variables are preserved if the -p option is used).  Then the HOME, PATH, SHELL, TERM, MAIL, and LOGNAME environment variables are
       set.  PATH defaults to /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin for normal users, and to /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin for  root.
       Last,  if this is not a "quiet" login, the message of the day is printed and the file with the user’s name in /var/spool/mail will be checked, and a
       message printed if it has non-zero length.
