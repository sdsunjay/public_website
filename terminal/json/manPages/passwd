PASSWD(1)                       User utilities                       PASSWD(1)

NAME
       passwd - update user’s authentication tokens

SYNOPSIS
       passwd [-k] [-l] [-u [-f]] [-d] [-n mindays] [-x maxdays] [-w warndays]
       [-i inactivedays] [-S] [--stdin] [username]

DESCRIPTION
       The passwd utility is used to update user’s authentication token(s).

       This task is achieved through calls to the Linux-PAM and  Libuser  API.
       Essentially, it initializes itself as a "passwd" service with Linux-PAM
       and utilizes configured  password  modules  to  authenticate  and  then
       update a user’s password.

       A simple entry in the global Linux-PAM configuration file for this ser-
       vice would be:

        #
        # passwd service entry that does strength checking of
        # a proposed password before updating it.
        #
        passwd password requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3
        passwd password required pam_unix.so use_authtok
        #

       Note, other module types are not required for this application to func-
       tion correctly.
