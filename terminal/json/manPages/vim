NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [options] [file ..]
DESCRIPTION
       Vim  is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.


       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.
